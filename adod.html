            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System, is named after the Roman god Mercurius, associated with commerce and communication. Classified as a terrestrial planet like Earth, Mercury exhibits a heavily cratered surface due to billions of years of impact events. It features a prominent crater, Caloris Planitia, and geological formations similar to those on the Moon, including rupes systems and bright ray systems.
            <p>With a unique spin-orbit resonance, Mercury's sidereal year and sidereal day are in a 3:2 ratio, resulting in significant variations in sunlight intensity and temperature across its surface. The equatorial regions experience extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from -170 °C at night to 420 °C during sunlight. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury's poles remain permanently shadowed, potentially harboring water ice in craters.
            <p>Internally, Mercury consists of a solid silicate crust and mantle overlaying a solid outer core, a liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Its high density suggests a large iron-rich core, comprising about 57% of its volume. The planet's surface exhibits numerous narrow ridges formed as its core and mantle cooled and contracted.
            </p>
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>Mercury's surface is characterized by extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, suggesting geological inactivity for billions of years. It displays various features such as wrinkle-ridges, Moon-like highlands, mountains, plains, escarpments, and valleys. The planet's mantle is chemically heterogeneous, indicating a past magma ocean phase. Mercury's surface is composed of iron-poor pyroxene, olivine, sodium-rich plagioclase, and minerals of mixed magnesium, calcium, and iron-sulfide. The presence of carbon-rich regions suggests the presence of graphite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features on Mercury are named according to the IAU planetary nomenclature system, with craters named after artists, musicians, and authors, ridges after scientists, and valleys after abandoned cities. Mercury experienced heavy bombardment during its formation and the Late Heavy Bombardment, resulting in widespread cratering. Notable features include the Caloris Basin and the "Weird Terrain."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mercury's surface temperature ranges from 100 to 700 K, with permanent shadowed areas near the poles potentially containing water ice. The planet lacks a significant atmosphere but has a tenuous exosphere composed of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, silicon, and hydroxide. Water vapor and ice have been detected on Mercury's surface.
            </p>
            <p>Despite its small size and lack of atmosphere, Mercury possesses a significant magnetic field, likely generated by a dynamo effect in its iron-rich liquid core. This magnetic field creates a magnetosphere that deflects solar wind, contributing to space weathering on the planet's surface. MESSENGER observations revealed magnetic tornadoes and flux transfer events, indicating a dynamic magnetosphere.</p>
